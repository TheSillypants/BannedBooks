## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data in}
p1_2 <- read.csv("/home/luka/Banned Books: At Least We're Not Burning Them/Data/PEN America's Index of School Book Bans (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022) - Sorted by Author & Title.csv")

p2_3 <- read.csv("/home/luka/Banned Books: At Least We're Not Burning Them/Data/PEN America's Index of School Book Bans (July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023) - Sorted by Author & Title.csv")

p3_4 <- read.csv("/home/luka/Banned Books: At Least We're Not Burning Them/Data/PEN America's Index of School Book Bans (July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024) - Sorted by Author & Title.csv")
```

```{r cleaning func 1}

setColTitles <- function(data) {
 data2 <- data[-1,]
 colNames <- colnames(data2)
 newColNames <- as.list(data2[1,])
 print(data2)
 for (x in colNames) {
   for (y in newColNames) {
     data2 <- data2 %>% rename( y = x )
   }
 }
 #data2 <- data2 %>% rename( "Author" = "X")
} 


setColTitles(p1_2)
```

Long story short, the above is crap. Apparently, read_csv has a *skip* option, that does exactly this. **Easily. In 8 characters.** Coding never fails to remind us of our own stupidity

``` {r re-import the pen data}
p1_2 <- read.csv("/home/luka/Banned Books: At Least We're Not Burning Them/Data/PEN America's Index of School Book Bans (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022) - Sorted by Author & Title.csv", skip =2)
p1_2 <- p1_2 %>% rename("Ban.Status" = "Type.of.Ban")
p1_2 <- p1_2 %>% mutate(Series.Name = "Unknown")

## New Plan
  
  remove all dupes from description
  write function to append descriptions to the array
  write similar function for political data
  


```{r}
