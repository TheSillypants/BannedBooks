# What was the most banned book?

```{r}
most_banned_book <- new_data %>%
  count(Title, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(Title)

# Crank appears as most banned book
states_banned <- new_data %>%
  filter(Title == most_banned_book) %>%
  distinct(State) %>%
  pull(State)

cat("Most banned book:", most_banned_book, "\n")
# Crank appears as most banned book 
cat("States that banned it:\n")
print(states_banned)

```
This code allows us to see that Crank was the most banned book in the dataset. It was banned by 19 states. 


```{r}
crank_data <- new_data %>%
  filter(Title == most_banned_book)

```

# Frequency of Crank's ban (categorized by state political control)
```{r}
#  frequency of bans by year
ggplot(crank_data, aes(x = factor(Year), fill = State.Control)) +
  geom_bar() +
   scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("Rep" = "red", "Dem" = "blue", "Divided" = "purple", "N/A" = "gray"),
    labels = c("Rep" = "Republican", "Dem" = "Democrat", "Divided" = "Divided")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Yearly Frequency of *Crank* Bans by Ellen Hopkins",
    subtitle = "Categorized by State Political Control",
    x = "Year", y = "Number of Bans",
    fill = "State Political Control"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
See a dramatic increase in bans of the book "Crank" in 2023, the year after book banning bills were introduced. 

# Bans and Pending Bans of Crank in States and their Political Control 
```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=8, fig.width=15}

# Step 1: Add Ban.Category
crank_data <- new_data %>%
  filter(Title == "Crank") %>%
  mutate(Ban.Category = case_when(
    grepl("Pending Investigation", Ban.Status, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Pending",
    grepl("Banned", Ban.Status, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Banned",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# Step 2: Summarize by State, Category, and Political Control
ban_combined <- crank_data %>%
  group_by(State, Ban.Category, State.Control) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Step 3: Plot
ggplot(ban_combined, aes(x = reorder(State, -Count), y = Count, fill = State.Control)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +
  facet_wrap(~Ban.Category, scales = "free_y") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("Rep" = "red", "Dem" = "blue", "Divided" = "purple", "N/A" = "gray"),
    labels = c("Rep" = "Republican", "Dem" = "Democrat", "Divided" = "Divided", "N/A" = "N/A")

Can see that Iowa and Floria were number 1 and 2 in banning this book. Some bans are still pending.
